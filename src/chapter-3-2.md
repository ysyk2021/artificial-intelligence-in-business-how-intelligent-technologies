Businesses are investing heavily in AI research and development, with global spending on AI and cognitive systems expected to reach $57.6 billion by 2021. This investment is driven by the potential for AI to deliver significant improvements in efficiency and profitability across various industries.

### Greater Emphasis on Explainable AI

Explainable AI refers to the ability of machines to explain their decision-making processes in a transparent way. As AI becomes more pervasive in business, there is a growing interest in developing explainable AI models that can be trusted by both businesses and consumers.

### Rise of Edge Computing

Edge computing refers to the processing and analysis of data at or near the point where it is generated, rather than in a centralized data center. This approach is becoming increasingly important for businesses that are using AI to process large volumes of data in real-time.

### Expansion of AI Ethics and Governance

As AI becomes more pervasive in business, there is a growing need for ethical and governance frameworks to ensure that these technologies are developed and deployed in a responsible and transparent way. This includes considerations around data privacy, bias, and accountability.
